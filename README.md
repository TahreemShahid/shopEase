## State Management Approach

The state management in this application is handled using a combination of **React's Context API** for global state and the **`useState` hook** for local, component-specific state.

-   **Global State (Context API):**
    -   **`CartContext`**: Manages the state of the shopping cart, including the items and total price.
    -   **`WishlistContext`**: Manages the user's wishlist.
    -   **`ToastContext`**: Handles the display of toast notifications across the application.
    This approach allows shared data to be accessed by any component without "prop drilling."

-   **Local State (`useState`):**
    -   Used for component-specific state, such as modal visibility, form inputs (like the selected payment method), and UI state (like the active product category).

This hybrid strategy demonstrates a modern and efficient approach to state management in React.
